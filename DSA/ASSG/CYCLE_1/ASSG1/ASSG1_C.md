# Q1

Given two integer arrays A and B, implement the following functions on them using hashing:
### (a) union(A,B) or union(B,A): prints the union of the elements of A and B (or B and A) in theorder of appearance of elements in A followed by B (or B followed by A).

### (b) intersection(A,B) or intersection(B,A): prints the intersection of the elements of A and B(or B and A) in the order of appearance of elements in A followed by B (or B followed by A).

### (c) setDifference(A,B) or setDifference(B,A): prints the set difference of the elements of A andB (or B and A) in the order of appearance of elements in A (or B).

## Constraints:
- Do not use sorting.  
- Do not consider duplicate elements.  
- The hash table size should not be greater than **2*max(m, n)**. Use open addressing for handling collisions in hashing.  
- 1<=A[i],B[i] <=100
