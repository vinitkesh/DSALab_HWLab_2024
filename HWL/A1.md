Write a MIPS assembly program for the following:


1. Check if the given positive number is odd or even.
1. Compute the factorial of a given positive number.
1. Check whether the given positive number is a palindrome or not.
1. Convert a given 32-bit binary number to its decimal equivalent.
1. Determine if a given integer is a perfect number. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because the sum of its proper divisors (1, 2, and 3) equals 6.
1. Check if a given number is an Armstrong number or not. [Example: Armstrong Number is 153 as (1*1*1) +(5*5*5) +(3*3*3) = 153.
1. Find the number of prime numbers and print them in a given range.
1. Find a given element (key) from the input array using a linear search.
1. Find the nth Fibonacci number for the given number n.
1. Perform an addition operation on two numbers, A and B. Where A is a signed number and B is the 2's complement of A.
1. Change the case (upper to lower and vice versa) of all the alphabets in a given string.
