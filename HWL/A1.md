Write a MIPS assembly program for the following:


1. Check if the given positive number is odd or even.
1. Compute the factorial of a given positive number.
1. Check whether the given positive number is a palindrome or not.
1. Convert a given 32-bit binary number to its decimal equivalent.
1. Determine if a given integer is a perfect number. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because the sum of its proper divisors (1, 2, and 3) equals 6.
1. Check if a given number is an Armstrong number or not. [Example: Armstrong Number is 153 as (1*1*1) +(5*5*5) +(3*3*3) = 153.
1. Find the number of prime numbers and print them in a given range.
1. Find a given element (key) from the input array using a linear search.
1. Find the nth Fibonacci number for the given number n.
1. Perform an addition operation on two numbers, A and B. Where A is a signed number and B is the 2's complement of A.
1. Change the case (upper to lower and vice versa) of all the alphabets in a given string.

## Q1. Check if the given positive number is odd or even
```MIPS
.data
	prompt: .asciiz "Enter your number: "
	result: .asciiz "A result of 0 is even, 1 is odd: result = "

.text
.globl main
main:
    # Get input value
    addi $v0, $zero, 4    # Write Prompt
    la $a0, prompt
    syscall

    addi $v0, $zero, 5    # Retrieve input
    syscall
    move $s0, $v0
    
    # Check if odd or even
    addi $t0, $zero, 2    # Store 2 in $t0
    div $t0, $s0, $t0     # Divide input by 2
    mfhi $s1              # Save remainder in $s1
    
    # Print output        
    addi $v0, $zero, 4    # Print result string
    la $a0, result
    syscall
    addi $v0, $zero, 1    # Print result
    move $a0, $s1
    syscall
    
    #Exit program
    addi $v0, $zero, 10
    syscall
```
